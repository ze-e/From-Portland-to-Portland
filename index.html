        From Portland, Maine to Portland, Oregon we're going to take you on an exciting journey through some 
        unknown regions of your country. Leave the car at home and travel by bike starting in New England 
        where it all began. You will pass through 12 beautiful states, covering a total of 3,600 miles, and
        accomplish 3 monumental missions. Partying and taking a selfie with a famous rock star, donating $1 
        to a billionaire to help eradicate polio in Africa, and even stopping by famous author Stephen King's 
        house to say hi and asking him to sign your favorite book.</p>

            Still, as sparsely populated as it was in the 1600s, this is an extraordinary and highly
            underrated state full of rich history and majestic natural beauty. Maine is the main state
            you want to be sure not to miss. As your journey is going to be a long one, you had best 
            be prepared for an arduous trek. 
          </p>
          <p class="place__paragraph">
            Thankfully, not only is Maine home to the very first European settlers on US territory in 
            the era of Vikings, but is also home to L.L. Bean, which is a great company to grab a 
            super sturdy backpack from for your 3-month expedition.

          There's no better place to lose yourself in nature than in springtime New Hampshire. 
          As serene and beautiful as it was in the 1700s, this state is still much less traveled 
          than its neighbors to the South. So enjoy it while it lasts.

          You won't be on your bike the whole time, so doesn't it make sense to pick up some extra 
          footwear? Fortunately for you, the best outdoor shoe company in the history of the world 
          proudly hails from this state. Cycle by the Timberland headquarters in Stratham, and pick 
          up a pair of rugged, waterproof boots to keep your feet dry. Fitting for unpredictable 
          weather you may be confronted by while passing through the Appalachians. These boots are 
          also better than cycling shoes when pitching a tent.

        Not only famous for “The Big Apple,” the state of NY also has several other reasons 
        for going down in history. Since the late 1800s Schenectady, “The City that Lights and 
        Hauls the World,” has been home to the world-famous General Electric Company.
      </p>
      <p class="place__paragraph">
        This is where modern power generators were born as well as contemporary means of 
        transmitting energy. So we figured this would be the perfect place to find a batteryless 
        dynamo light for your bicycle to help you see through those dark lonely roads on your 
        adventure. Such a light from GE will set you back about $10-20.

      Erie, Pennsylvania, not to be confused with the word “eerie,” although it can be from 
      time to time, is another town worth passing through for several different reasons. While 
      it might be most famously known as the scene of the Gettysburg address delivered by 
      Mr. Lincoln during the Civil war, Pennsylvania also has produced a rather decent-sized 
      Amish community (eerie, huh?) </p>
    <p class="place__paragraph">
      The reason we've brought you here today, if you haven't already guessed, can be summed up 
      by using one delicious word: chocolate. Hershey's is a Pennsylvania-based company. Most 
      likely, one of the tastiest missions you'll ever embark on during this tour, try to find 
      an Amish friend and enjoy a bar in the National Wildlife Refuge on your way to Erie and 
      have an extra eerie time!
    </p>
    <p class="place__paragraph">
    The current cost of a Hershey's Chocolate bar: about 60¢.

            From the college capital of Columbus to the clean 
              coastline of Cleveland, Ohio is a truly hidden gem. Earthquakes are surprisingly 
              common in this particular region of North America, over 200 of which have 
              registered with a magnitude of 2 or higher since 1776. However, earthquakes 
              aren't the only thing shaking this centrally located state. One of the country's 
              largest and oldest roller coaster parks is waiting to ROCK your world 
              in Sandusky, Ohio! This will presumably be one of the most thrilling quests you'll 
              ever complete (provided you can stomach it). Take a much-deserved break to ride as many 
              roller coasters as you can before continue your bike ride!

            The cost of a daily ticket: about $100.
